Cyber Threat Detection Using Machine Learning

1. Abstract
  This project presents a machine learning–based intrusion detection system using Random Forest and Isolation Forest. The system processes large network datasets and provides visual dashboards including charts, 3D plots, and geonmaps.
2. Introduction
  Cyberattacks continue to grow in complexity and frequency. Manual network monitoring is inefficient. Machine learning offers automated detection of malicious traffic.
3. Problem Statement
  Traditional signature-based systems fail to detect unknown attacks. There is a need for a fast, ML based system with visualization support.
4. Objectives
  - Detect attacks using ML
  - Provide visual analytics
  - Support large CSV datasets
  - Generate severity scores
  - Map attacks globally
5. Methodology
  Data preprocessing, feature alignment, Random Forest prediction, Isolation Forest anomaly detection, and visual dashboards.
6. Results
  High accuracy, 3D threat visualization, and global attack mapping.
7. Conclusion
  This system successfully detects attacks and provides powerful visual analysis tools.
8. Future Work
  Deep learning, alerting, real-time packet inspection.
